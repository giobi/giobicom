GitHub Pages Deployment Diagnostic
===================================

‚úÖ WORKING COMPONENTS:
- GitHub Actions workflow executed successfully
- Astro build process completed
- dist/ folder generated with all files
- index.html created (size: ~45KB)
- Asset files properly linked with /giobicom25/ base
- .nojekyll file present (prevents Jekyll processing)

üîç DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS:
- Site URL: https://giobi.github.io/giobicom25/
- Expected: Working website
- If 404 shown: GitHub Pages source misconfigured

‚ùå LIKELY ISSUE:
GitHub Pages "Source" setting is incorrect.

üîß SOLUTION:
1. Go to: https://github.com/giobi/giobicom25/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", change from "Deploy from a branch" to "GitHub Actions"
3. Save settings
4. Wait for next push to trigger deployment

üìã VERIFICATION:
- If you can access: https://giobi.github.io/giobicom25/status
- Or this file: https://giobi.github.io/giobicom25/github-pages-diagnostic.txt
- Then the deployment IS working, just needs source configuration

‚ö° QUICK TEST:
Try accessing: https://giobi.github.io/giobicom25/status
If it loads, the build is fine - just fix the GitHub Pages source setting.
