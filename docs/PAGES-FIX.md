# GitHub Pages Configuration Fix

## Issue: Jekyll Processing Astro Files

If you're experiencing build failures with errors like:
- "Invalid YAML front matter in /github/workspace/src/pages/*.astro"
- "mapping values are not allowed in this context"
- Jekyll trying to process `.astro` files

This means GitHub Pages is misconfigured to use Jekyll instead of GitHub Actions.

## Root Cause

GitHub Pages has two deployment modes:
1. **Deploy from a branch** (Legacy Jekyll processing) ‚ùå
2. **GitHub Actions** (Custom workflows) ‚úÖ

When set to "Deploy from a branch", GitHub automatically runs Jekyll on your repository, which cannot process Astro files.

## Solution

### Step 1: Change Repository Settings
1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/giobi/giobicom25
2. Click the **Settings** tab
3. In the left sidebar, scroll down and click **Pages**
4. Under **Source**, change from "Deploy from a branch" to **"GitHub Actions"**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
1. Make a small change to any file and push to the `main` branch
2. Go to **Actions** tab to see the workflow run
3. The Astro deployment workflow should run instead of Jekyll
4. Site should deploy successfully to: https://giobi.github.io/giobicom25

## Expected Results

### Before Fix (Jekyll Error)
```
ERROR: YOUR SITE COULD NOT BE BUILT:
Invalid YAML front matter in /github/workspace/src/pages/blog.astro
```

### After Fix (Astro Success)
```
‚úÖ Build completed successfully!
üìÅ Generated files: dist/
üöÄ This build will be deployed to GitHub Pages
```

## Prevention

Always ensure new repositories with custom workflows are set to use "GitHub Actions" as the Pages source. The `.nojekyll` file in the repository helps prevent Jekyll processing but doesn't override the repository settings.
