# 🚨 GitHub Pages 404 Fix Guide

## Problem
The site https://giobi.github.io/giobicom25/ shows a 404 error despite successful deployments.

## Root Cause
GitHub Pages is configured to use "Deploy from a branch" instead of "GitHub Actions", causing Jekyll to try processing Astro files (which fails).

## ✅ Verified Working Components
- ✅ Astro build process (generates proper files)
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow (deploys successfully) 
- ✅ `.nojekyll` file (prevents Jekyll when source is GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Correct asset paths (`/giobicom25/` base)
- ✅ Valid `index.html` file (45KB, well-formed)

## 🔧 Solution (Manual Fix Required)

**The GitHub Pages source setting must be changed manually:**

1. **Go to Repository Settings**
   - Visit: https://github.com/giobi/giobicom25/settings/pages

2. **Change Source Setting**
   - Under "Source", change from **"Deploy from a branch"** to **"GitHub Actions"**
   - Click **Save**

3. **Trigger New Deployment**
   - Make any small change to the repository (edit README, etc.)
   - Push to `main` branch
   - GitHub Actions will deploy using the Astro build

- **Main Site**: https://giobi.github.io/giobicom25/
- **Status Page**: https://giobi.github.io/giobicom25/status
- **Diagnostic**: https://giobi.github.io/giobicom25/github-pages-diagnostic.txt

## 📋 Why This Happens
1. GitHub defaults new repositories to "Deploy from a branch" (Jekyll mode)
2. Jekyll cannot process `.astro` files → build fails → 404
3. Switching to "GitHub Actions" uses our custom Astro workflow → success

## 🔍 How to Verify Fix Worked
1. After changing the setting, check the Actions tab
2. Next deployment should show "Deploy to GitHub Pages" job
3. Site should load at https://giobi.github.io/giobicom25/

**This is a one-time configuration fix that cannot be automated via code.**
